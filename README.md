## **Numerical methods and optimization algorithms**

This repository contains implementations covering key topics in numerical analysis, linear algebra, differential equations, and optimization algorithms.

### Table of Contents

By the end of the initial version, the repository will be structured as follows:

 - Linear Systems and Gaussian Elimination
 - Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues
 - Numerical Integration
 - Monte Carlo Simulations
 - Differential Equations
     - Euler's Method
     - Runge-Kutta Method
 - Optimization Algorithms
     - Gradient Descent
     - Stochastic Gradient Descent
     - ADAM Optimizer

Currently we are at Linear Systems and Gaussian Elimination with the implementation of gaussian elimination to solve linear systems of equations and matrix inversion.
